                In early 2006 I was considering starting a podcast. It, of
                course, needed a name. Living in Moscow, Russia, at the time,
                Rosnovsky Park (as in Gorky park) made perfect sense. I've
                diverted from this brand a few times, but it's so dear to my
                heart that I always come back.

                Hi, I'm Art Rosnovsky. I'm a software engineer and web developer
                from Greater Seattle area, working mostly with JavaScript stack
                (JavaScript, React, Node), and venturing to the land of C#/.NET
                every now and again. I solve problems, one line of code at a
                time.
              </p>
              <p>
                More often than not, I'm invited by businesses of all sizes to
                come on board and deliver a product, per specs, within a few
                months. This is, basically, my specialty: I come in, solve
                problems, build projects, and deliver products, all on a tight
                schedule.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have a project for me, or have a problem you need solved,
                just email me at artem@rosnovsky.us
              </p>
            </div>
          </PostFullContent>
        </article>
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </Wrapper>
  </IndexLayout>
