Looks like this place becomes more of a blog than I expected. Oh, well :) Today, I'm documenting a bunch of random things that I've been preoccupied with for the past few weeks (or maybe months?)

It's Thursday, my day off. Yep, I worked last Saturday and got to choose any day or the following week to take as a day off. What am going to do? Oh, I don't know. Drive to Snohomish Library and read by the fireplace with a cup of coffee? Go to "Blazing Onion" for their Impossible Burger? Ride a ferry to Bainbridge Island for no reason? Code some stuff for fun? We'll see. But for now, a life update is in order.

## Life

Life has been quiet lately. We just extended our lease for another year, so this year we are not planning to move. For the first time in forever we're living in the same place for over two years, and it's a nice feeling.

I'm very slowly wrapping my head around a combination of GraphQL, MongoDB, Svelte and serverless functions. A few weeks back I [announced Pinetype](/blog/2020/02/02/do-you-want-to-build-a-service/), a braindumping service with mental health focus, and it's been slow start. So far, i'm still trying to build a very basic proof of concept, and apparently it's more difficult than I expected. It's ok, we'll get there. Feel free to join ;)

I've started working on a new tattoo, and it's about 75% done. Unlike my first tattoo, this one is truly special to me, and I've put a lot of work and thought into it. My wonderful artist Molly will finish it in early March. But honestly, I love it so much as it is, I can't imagine what it's going to be like to have it all finished!

Recent weeks were very stable, busy and fulfilling, which was great for my mental state. I feel so content and comfortable being myself, and it's a great feeling! I'm much calmer, less stressed out, less anxious, and much more optimistic. I'm also very grateful and energetic.

I'm tentatively back on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rosnovsky). I mostly read industry-related stuff and post links I find interesting. I've been doing this on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/rosnovsky) for a while now, but I'm not sure yet how I feel about being back on Twitter.

I'm kinda sorta back on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/rosnovsky) & [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rosnovsky). I haven't been there since August, and it felt great. I still despise Facebook and its services, but had to come back to catch up with friends and family. Interestingly enough, I basically login every week or so, look through whatever is in the feed, like a few pictures, and move on.

## Work

I just realized that I've never explained what we do at Auth0, and what's my role is all about. Auth0 provides identity management for application builders so innovators can innovate. With Auth0 is simple to protect your API endpoints, manage your users, introduce social connections, etc. But simple things are very difficult to make, and identity management is no exception. Unlike many in-house teams, we have dedicated a disproportionate amount of resources to make things secure, easy to use, extensible and scalable for developers and end users.

- what we do and why

It's free to try,there's a great community, and we offer generous free plan.

- helpful guides
- day to day

### Weekend shifts

### Morning routine

In the past few weeks, I've changed my bedtime to around 10pm, and now I wake up at 6:30 or earlier, well rested and full of anticipation of the day ahead.

I eat breakfast at work more often than not.
