This is my second TEDx. I've been to the "Pacific Wonderland" TEDxPortland in 2016, and it absolutely blew my mind. I didn't have a chance to attend Seattle's show last year, so as soon as tickets went on sale in 2019, I grabbed one.

As I'm writing this, it's "Session 5" (the intermission); I'm sitting at the top level of jam-packed McCaw Auditorium, and I'm trying to process talks as they come.

## Pain and Virtual Reality

[Sam Sharar](https://tedxseattle.com/speakers/sam-sharar/) talked about using virtual reality to ease pain in severely burned patients. Convincing and a clear example of _fad_ technology being life-changing.

## Unconscious Bias

[Karen Okonokwo](https://tedxseattle.com/speakers/karen-okonkwo/) talked about unconscious bias when it comes to representation of black faces in various media, and how it affects non-white people growing up. It's eye-opening how we unconsciously perceive certain things as the norm just because we see them everywhere. Try for example searching for "couple" or "boss". Karen started a minority-focused stock photography website, and it's so awesome to see their work spreading around!

## Animal Advocacy

[Leah Garc√©s](https://tedxseattle.com/speakers/leah-garces/) talked about going to the perceived enemy and making a human connection to promote change. She's an avid animal advocate fighting with factory farming. It's awesome to see farmers turn their chicken factories into hemp and marijuana greenhouses! Also, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods (and those who follow) are holding keys to the future of food. Yep. Called it!
