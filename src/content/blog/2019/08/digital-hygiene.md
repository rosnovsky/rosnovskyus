I've been cleaning up my digital life for the past couple of months. The deeply underlying reasons are not important (let's just say, it's all a part of a bigger self-care and mental health regimen), so I'll go with the more on the surface ones here.

## Social Media

For me, social media was a way to socialize since its inception. I've got my invite into LiveJournal in 2003 and have been on social media ever since. I've moved to Facebook, and to Twitter, and to Instagram, I tried new sites as they popped up into existence only to disappear forever just a few years later. After I left my country of birth, social media became a way to keep up with friends and family. It all changed over time into a feeding tube, a constant fire hose of text, images, status updates, new, and, sure, ads. Scandal after scandal, these companies were getting away with everything, from storing and leaking plain-text passwords to breaking a democracy. I got so fed up with this, that over a year ago I made my first attempt to quit ([announcement in Russian](https://podtema.com/blog/2018/04/02/rosnovsky-park-second-coming/)). I've made a few strategic mistakes, and my experiment didn't stick for too long; I think, I was back on Facebook within 2 weeks. This time it's different. This time, I'm truly ready, and I have all the things and attitudes I need to never look back.

## Life after mainstream social media

It's really a huge privilege to be able to just quit Facebook. For so many people around the world, Facebook *is* the internet, and quitting it is just not an option. For me, luckily, it's very much an option. I'm missing out, of course, since everyone and their grandmother is on Facebook, sharing baby pictures and concert invites, but my wife keeps me in the loop of truly important things and you know what? I'm still available! You have to be deliberate as in explicitly share things with that you think I might be interested in. I know, it's hard to believe, but that's how things used to be: you have friends and you don't just make radio announcements whenever you find something you want to share with them. You'd call, text, talk to them over a coffee, send them a post pigeon or roll in a clay plate. Whatever you do, you're deliberate in your communications and relationships.

And you know what? It appears to be a good filter (well, still not sure if it's good or bad, but it's *a filter*). I used to struggle with guilt over the fact that I'm not connecting with people enough; I don't call or text my friends that much, but hey, phones work both ways. If I don't call or text you and therefore we lose connection, you weren't calling me either. So was it ever a meaningful thing to begin with?..
