A few weeks ago, I published a [list of the best tech and dev podcasts](/blog/tech-podcasts-in-2019/). I've got so much feedback and so many excellent suggestions, that it's time for a Community Update. I've also got very curios about open source recently and I've included some of my newly favorite FOSS podcasts as well.
