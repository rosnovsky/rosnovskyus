In 2005, I bought my first Mac mini. It had 1.25 Ghz G3 processor, like, 256 Mb of RAM and a 40 Gb HDD. At the moment, it was the most exciting device I've ever owned. Mac OS X was such a blow of fresh air after Windows XP! It was well-designed, friendly, relatively fast, quiet. It had all the apps I wanted to use, and since I've never been a gamer, lack of gaming titles didn't bother me at all. I was in love with Apple. In the years since, I owned a bunch of laptops, a couple of iMacs, all kinds of iPhones, iPads, and a pair of Apple Watches. My family is a full Apple house.

Apple of 2005 is not the same company as Apple in 2019. I'm not going to get into everything that makes Apple of 2019 a Microsoft of 2005, and it's not fair to compare them one to one, still, I'm convinced that these two have way more in common these days then they are different. Anyway, I'm not here to start another holy war, I'm just documenting my jorney here.
