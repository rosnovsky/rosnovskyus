A few weeks ago, I published a [list of the best tech and dev podcasts](/blog/tech-podcasts-in-2019/). I've got so much feedback and so many excellent suggestions, that it's time for a Community Update. I've also got very curios about Free and Open Source Software recently and I've included some of my newly favorite FOSS podcasts as well.

Also, I've [switched to Linux](/blog/2019/08/25/mac-to-linux/) recently (haven't updated the post to reflect that I've moved to Manjaro already), so there's a pretty significat bias towards Linux-related podcasts.

### 1. [Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes)

Absolutely brilliant show by Red Hat. In the latest season they were going through programming languages: where they come from, how the evolve, and how some of them end up neglected and forgotten, while others thrive and gain more and more followers. Previous seasons are full of programming and open source history, and it's now absolutely one of my favorite podcasts. As a side note, I know some people are not really thrilled about vendor podcasts, but this is not a show _about_ Red Hat, it is a show _by_ Red Hat.

### 2. [Darknet Dairies](https://darknetdiaries.com/)

Oh. My. God. This is such an excellent production, storytelling, and depth of subject knowledge, I can't even. I look forward to every episode as if it was the next Stranger Things season. Absolutely incredible deep dives into hacking culture, famous and infamous hacks, and just amazing stories from the darkest corners of the internet and hacking underground. Breathtaking journeys unravel before your ears, from hacking XBoxes to ransomeware underground to IRS hacks, every episode is a true treasure and a timeless piece of internet history. Clearly, 10 out of 10.

### 3. [This Week In Linux](https://tuxdigital.com/thisweekinlinux/)

All the latest Linux GNUews (?), from kernel updates, to apps and hardware.

### 4. [Ubuntu Podcast](http://ubuntupodcast.org/)

A really nice and easy-going show, where a few people talk all things Ubuntu. The pace might feel slow, but it's a part of the overall spirit of the show; usually, covers Ubuntu-related news, and broader Linux Kernel and FOSS topics.

### 5. [Going Linux](http://goinglinux.com/)

One of the helpful and friendly shows for those switching to Linux or contemplating their options. Distros, differences between Windows and Linux, how-tos and so forth. Regular community Q&A episodes where the hosts answer questions, so don't hesitate to participate!

### 6. [IRL](https://irlpodcast.org/)

Another "vendor" podcast on the list. This one comes from Mozilla, one of my favorite companies. Sure they had their fair share of missteps over the years, but IRL is certainly not one of them.
