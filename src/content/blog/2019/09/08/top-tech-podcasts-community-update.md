A few weeks ago, I published a [list of the best tech and dev podcasts](/blog/tech-podcasts-in-2019/). I've got so much feedback and so many excellent suggestions, that it's time for a Community Update. I've also got very curios about Free and Open Source Software recently and I've included some of my newly favorite FOSS podcasts as well.

Also, I've [switched to Linux](/blog/2019/08/25/mac-to-linux/) recently (haven't updated the post to reflect that I've moved to Manjaro already), so there's a pretty significat bias towards Linux-related podcasts.

### 1. [Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes)

Absolutely brilliant show by Red Hat. In the latest season they were going through programming languages: where they come from, how the evolve, and how some of them end up neglected and forgotten, while others thrive and gain more and more followers. Previous seasons are full of programming and open source history, and it's now absolutely one of my favorite podcasts. As a side note, I know some people are not really thrilled about vendor podcasts, but this is not a show _about_ Red Hat, it is a show _by_ Red Hat.
