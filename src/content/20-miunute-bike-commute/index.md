In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9tx6BbOFEc), I'm riding my [RadCity](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radcity-electric-commuter-bike) eBike with pedal-assist system from home to work. In February 2018, I broke my right leg, and this eBike became a rare accessible exercise vehicle for me. I enjoyed my rides immensely (the scenery is plane but nice), biked over 500 hundred miles (here's my first [100-mile milestone](/100-miles-biking-milestone/index/)), and gained back some of the strength in my broken leg.
