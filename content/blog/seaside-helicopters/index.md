Oh, there's a funny story here. So, this one is from the time when we just moved to America from Canada, and decided to treat ourselves to a helicopter ride. Apparently, helicopter rides are **expensive**. 15-minute ride for a family of 3 cost us a few hundred dollars. Well, I though it was ridiculous and an outrage, and decided to go to take some piloting lessons to be able to take my family on such trips whenever I want, 5-10 times cheaper. It didn't work out exactly the way I wanted, but I did indeed had a great time flying with then in Nevada, and along the Columbia river. 

Here's a [video from this historic helicopter ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpSmobOhiVQ) along the Oregon coast.
