First off, I didn't _really_ participate in this year's Climate Srike. I only learned about it a few days ahead of time (a side effect of being [off social media](/blog/2019/08/21/digital-hygiene/)). All I did was taking a bus around town a few times, and not buying stuff. I obviously couldn't walkout from work (I was a contractor with 0 PTO daysin my final week of the project I've been working on), I didn't join any protests, and didn't radically organize my local community. Basically, I bailed almost completely. #ClimateStrike my ass!

With this being said, I find the idea very compelling. Climate emergency is not going anywhere, and with time it will only get worse. Time for drastic measures has already passed, practically nothing had been done, and now it's time to, basically, drop everything and try to save our species to the extent still possible. But how does one do this?.. Most of us have work, we need food, we pay exuberrant amounts in rent, while making barely enough to last till the end of the month working crappy job. I'm pretty well off compared to many, and have more choices (as in variety of choices as well as having to make more decisions).

But actually, day-to-day conscious, deliberate sustainable behavior. Perfect? No. Great? Perhaps, no. Better than nothing? Hell yes. Striving to improve? Absolutely!

## Food

## Shopping

## Transportation

## Home Sustainability

Could I move from my suburbian townhome to a tiny run-down apartment closer to where most of the jobs are? Perhaps. But it means shitty schools, terrible air quality, fewer to none shopping options (and I'm not talking about Ambercrombie and Finch kind of shopping, more of a QFC, Winco and Albertson's kind). Can we _all_ move to the downtown? I don't think it's feasable, at least not in the near future.

## Habits

## Mindset

My thing with these expensive, but more sustainable things is that you treasure them more; you waste less of it, you use it consciously and deliberately and mindfully.
