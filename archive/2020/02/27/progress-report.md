Looks like this place becomes more of a blog than I expected. Oh, well :) Today, I'm documenting a bunch of random things that I've been preoccupied with for the past few weeks (or maybe months?)

It's Thursday, my day off. Yep, I worked last Saturday and got to choose any day or the following week to take as a day off. What am going to do? Oh, I don't know. Drive to Snohomish Library and read by the fireplace with a cup of coffee? Go to "Blazing Onion" for their Impossible Burger? Ride a ferry to Bainbridge Island for no reason? Code some stuff for fun? We'll see. But for now, a life update is in order.

## Life

Life has been quiet lately. We just extended our lease for another year, so this year we are not planning to move. For the first time in forever we're living in the same place for over two years, and it's a nice feeling.

I'm very slowly wrapping my head around a combination of GraphQL, MongoDB, Svelte and serverless functions. A few weeks back I [announced Pinetype](/blog/2020/02/02/do-you-want-to-build-a-service/), a braindumping service with mental health focus, and it's been slow start. So far, i'm still trying to build a very basic proof of concept, and apparently it's more difficult than I expected. It's ok, we'll get there.

I've started working on a new tattoo, and it's about 75% done. Unlike my first tattoo, this one is truly special to me, and I've put a lot of work and thought into it. My wonderful artist Molly will finish it in early March. But honestly, I love it so much as it is, I can't imagine what it's going to be like to have it all finished!

Recent weeks were very stable, busy and fulfilling, which was great for my mental state. I feel so content and comfortable being myself, and it's a great feeling! I'm much calmer, less stressed out, less anxious, and much more optimistic. I'm also very grateful and more energetic.

I'm tentatively back on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rosnovsky). I mostly read industry-related stuff and post links I find interesting. I've been doing this on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/rosnovsky) for a while now, but I'm not sure yet how I feel about being back on Twitter.

I'm kinda sorta back on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/rosnovsky) & [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rosnovsky). I haven't been there since August, and it felt great. I still despise Facebook and its services, but had to come back to catch up with friends and family. Interestingly enough, I basically login every week or so, look through whatever is in the feed, like a few pictures, and move on.

## Work

I just realized that I've never explained what we do at [Auth0](https://auth0.com), and what's my role is. Auth0 provides identity management for application builders so innovators can innovate. With Auth0 is simple to protect your API endpoints, manage your users, let them signup or login with one of the [social connections](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/identity-providers-social), etc. But simple things are very difficult to make, and identity management is no exception. Unlike many in-house teams, we have dedicated a disproportionate amount of resources to make things secure, easy to use, extensible and scalable for developers, and delightful for end users. It's really easy, I promise! Just try one of our [Quickstarts](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstarts/), and let me know if you have any questions! Of course, [it's free to try](https://auth0.com/signup?&signUpData={"source"%3A"rosnovsky.us"}), we offer a generous [free plan](https://auth0.com/pricing/) (and a great free open-source option!), and there's a great community if you need help.

### Day to day

My job is to make sure things work smoothly for our customers. When they reach out for support, our support team takes care of investigation, analysis, troubleshooting, and ultimately providing a solution to the issue. Vast majority of issues are relatively easy to resolve, however, if there's a bug on our end, or if we experience some sort of an outage, it's on the developer support team to coordinate a response and make sure a fix is in place. 

- day to day
- incident response

### Opportunities

More often than not, when a recruiter reaches out to you, they talk about "opportunities" instead of positions and jobs. And more often than not, there's zero opportunity, and just a bunch of empty 

(har viewer, rules, docs, etc)

### Weekend shifts

### Morning routine

In the past few weeks, I've changed my bedtime to around 10pm, and now I wake up at 6:30 or earlier, well rested and full of anticipation of the day ahead.

I eat breakfast at work more often than not.

### Donut

Nice tradition (or a feature) is bi-weekly *donuts*

### Diversity and beyond

- Blood Drive (building, not company)
- Auth0 Gives (Australia story)
- Mental Wellbeing club (a bit of a backstory)
- Pride club (because of course)

- Helicopter ride
- Portland (Camp Namanu)
- Seattle Dragons (for the love of football)
- Bon Jovi
- Greenday
